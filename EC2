EC2

Amazon EC2 is the fundamental compute service in AWS that allows you to launch and manage virtual servers on demand. You can choose the operating system, instance type, CPU, memory, and storage based on your workload requirements. EC2 is highly flexible, supporting everything from small test servers to large clusters for enterprise workloads.â€¨â€¨When you create an EC2 instance, you pick:
* AMI (Amazon Machine Image): The base OS and configuration (Linux, Windows, custom images).
* Instance type: Hardware profile (CPU, memory, networking).
* Storage: Usually Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes attached.
* Networking: Place the instance inside a VPC, assign security groups, and optionally public IPs.
ðŸ”¹ Pricing Models (Cost Control)
* On-Demand: Pay per second/hour, great for dev/test or unpredictable workloads.
* Reserved Instances: Commit for 1â€“3 years, up to 70% cheaper, best for steady workloads.
* Spot Instances: Use spare AWS capacity at big discounts, but can be interrupted. Great for Jenkins agents, CI/CD builds, or fault-tolerant jobs.
* Savings Plans: Flexible commitments across instance types for cost optimization.
For DevOps, Spot Instances are a favorite: you can spin up short-lived build/test agents cheaply.

ðŸ”¹ Instance Families (Flexibility)
AWS offers many instance families, so you donâ€™t overspend or underpower workloads:
* General Purpose (t3, m6i, etc.) â†’ balanced compute/memory (web apps, dev/test).
* Compute Optimized (c5, c7g) â†’ CPU-heavy tasks (CI/CD builds, batch processing).
* Memory Optimized (r5, x2) â†’ databases, in-memory caching.
* Storage Optimized (i3, d2) â†’ high I/O for data warehousing, analytics.
* Accelerated Computing (p3, g5) â†’ GPUs for AI/ML, video rendering.
This flexibility is a huge advantage â€” instead of buying fixed hardware, you can pick the right family, then resize or switch as needs evolve.
â€¨ðŸ”¹ Advantages
* Highly flexible (instance types, OS, storage, networking).
* Scalable from one VM to thousands, with auto-scaling and load balancing.
* Pay-as-you-go with multiple cost models.
* Global reach with regions and availability zones.
ðŸ”¹ Disadvantages
* You manage the OS: patching, updates, monitoring.
* If you donâ€™t right-size or shut down idle instances, costs rise.
* Scaling isnâ€™t instant (booting takes minutes vs serverless which is near-instant).
* Pricing models can be complex to choose.
â€¨ðŸ”¹ Real-time Example (Storytelling Style)
In one of my projects, we had Jenkins running on AWS. Instead of keeping a big server running 24/7, we used a small EC2 instance for the Jenkins master and an Auto Scaling group of EC2 Spot Instances for Jenkins agents.
Hereâ€™s how it worked:
1. A developer pushed code to GitHub.
2. Jenkins master on EC2 triggered a pipeline.
3. The Auto Scaling Group spun up new EC2 Spot instances as build agents.
4. These agents checked out the code, built Docker images, uploaded artifacts to S3, and pushed images to ECR.
5. After the build finished, the Spot instances were automatically terminated.
This setup saved thousands of dollars because we only paid for EC2 when builds were actually running. It also scaled dynamically â€” if 10 builds came in parallel, 10 agents spun up without manual intervention.
